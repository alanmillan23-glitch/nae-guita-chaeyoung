Let's call it strawberry, blueberry I see it growing on the ground, You look like a bad one, avocado I gotta hide it underground, Feeling like a dream baby, it's all right I decided now, I've come to wonderland, no looking back Why would I look back now?, Believe me Deceive me See me as yours Believe me, Try me, Bite me, just once
